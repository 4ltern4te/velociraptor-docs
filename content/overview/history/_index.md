Velociraptor draws inspiration from two major projects:

* GRR  https://github.com/google/grr
* OSQuery https://github.com/osquery/osquery

In common

Hunting across large number of endpoints
Can collect file data
Free Open source (FOSS)

Different

Much faster
Lower footprint
A flexible query language
Very simple to deploy
Event based queries
Commercially supported FOSS

### Velociraptor vs OSQuery

In common

Rely on a query language to access machine state
Single binary with no dependencies
Multi-platform
Different

VQL is much more powerful and intuitive than SQL
Much faster than OSQuery
Can transfer file data
Can modify the system
Remote client/server control and orchestration in the same tool.
