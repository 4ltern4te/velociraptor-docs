Hunting everywhere

Hunting
Collecting the same artifact from many endpoints is called “hunting”.
A hunt is just a logical container for many individual collections
You can download all collections at the same time
You can see how many endpoints participated
You can select which machines will participate based on labels, OS or other conditions.

Hunting
Velociraptor hunts are always active until they expire
Endpoints not currently online will receive the hunt when they check in next.
Therefore the result set is always changing - you can prepare a new download to obtain the latest version of the hunt results.

Exercise - collect tasks everywhere
Repeat the previous artifact collection as a hunt.

This captures the state of the deployment at a point in time when the hunt was collected.

Velociraptor just collects artifacts - the artifact selection GUI is a repeating theme thats works the same way in different contexts!

You can target hunts at specific label groups or OS.
